Hello! Thank you so much for the purchase. I hope you find this tool useful.

If you have any trouble, please, contact me at 3dynamite.unity@gmail.com I'll do my best to help you.

I just want to warn you about a known issue:
If you are placing HUGE amounts of objects, maybe you'll notive a slow down. Fortunately, there's an easy fix. 
Open another scene, and get back to the original one and everything will be smooth again.

I'm sorry about this issue, but I didn't figured out how to fix it.


Also, there's a Custom Shader that supports Vertex Color. You can use it for using the "Vertex Color Variation" 
feature of this tool. You can find it under the dropdown in the shader selector of the material at this path: "3Dynamite/Surface Vertex Color"

Good bye and Have a happy development! :D
